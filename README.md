# Hi there

## Who am I?

A senior Computer Science and Mathematics student and self-taught programmer, interested in high frequency trading, quantitative research, low-level systems programming, ML algorithms, computational physics, and many more.

My current research interests that I want to pursue in graduate school include high-performance computing/parallelism, computer architectures, and GPU computing/architectures.

Always open to hearing about opportunities for new graduate full-time or internship opportunities, feel free to email me at <jhizgiae@stevens.edu>.
