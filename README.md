# Hi there, my name is Joshua Hizgiaev 
-----
## Who am I?
A freshman computer science student and self-taught programmer and have great interest in mathematics for AI (linear algebra) :computer:

Currently looking for internship opportunities, feel free to email at jhizgiaev2704@gmail.com

### Interests and concentrations/endeavors:
1. Creating artificial intelligence for theoretical concepts in mathematics and computer science as well as finance using data science tools such as Tensorflow, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Data Structures and Algorithms
4. Machine learning (Kinda similar to the first point)
5. Quantitative development using C++ (HFT's hopefully one day)

### What are the languages I have experience with?
- Java
- C
- C++
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Python

### Languages I am actually confortable with:

### Current objectives/goals:
- Continue learning machine learning and AI development with unique projects to showcase my progress (most likely tensorflow) over the summer
- Earn a summer internship during the summer of freshman year of college
- Study Data Structures and Algorithms in the summer using C++ and/or Python using pretty good books
- Practice the above with leetcode
