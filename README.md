# Hi there, my name is Joshua Hizgiaev 
--------------------------------------
## Who am I?
A freshman computer science student and self-taught programmer and have great interest in mathematics for AI (linear algebra) :computer:

Currently looking for internship opportunities, feel free to email at jhizgiaev2704@gmail.com

### What I been doing now
- I am a research assistant for [Professor Michael Greenberg](https://greenberg.science/) from Stevens on Static Site Generation, specfically on performance handling and building web tools and applications to run web-assembly IDE's on just a front-end!
- I additionally am a AI Research Intern at [Stevens Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.stevens.edu/stevens-institute-for-artificial-intelligence), currently working on analyzing terabytes of US employment data along with analyzing the growth of demand in data science and machine learning skill sets in the US job market!

### Interests and concentrations/endeavors:
1. Creating artificial intelligence for theoretical concepts in mathematics and computer science as well as finance using data science tools such as PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, Finance API's, etc
2. Data Structures and Algorithms
3. Machine learning (Kinda similar to the first point)
4. Quantitative development using C++ (HFT's hopefully one day)

### What are the languages I have experience with?
- Java
- C
- C++
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Python

### Languages I am actually confortable with:

### Current objectives/goals:
- Continue learning machine learning and AI development with unique projects to showcase my progress (most likely pytorch) over the summer
- Earn a summer internship during the summer of freshman year of college
- Study Data Structures and Algorithms in the summer using C++ and/or Python using pretty good books
- Practice the above with leetcode
